PinePhone Kernel
================

This document describes how to build and install the PinePhone kernel. Before getting to the actual compilation, we describe the PinePhone recovery. At the bottom there are some references relevant for kernel development.

Recovery
--------

The UBports image contains a recovery boot mode based on `jumpdrive <https://github.com/dreemurrs-embedded/Jumpdrive>`_. To get into the recovery press and hold the power and the volume up buttons until the led turns on.

The recovery presents the PinePhone as a network device and runs a telnet server.
When you connect the PinePhone to your desktop via USB, you will see the rndis device show up in your desktops ``dmesg``::

  usb 1-7.2: Product: PinePhone
  usb 1-7.2: Manufacturer: Pine64
  usb 1-7.2: SerialNumber: Jumpdrive
  rndis_host 1-7.2:1.0 usb0: register 'rndis_host' at usb-0000:00:14.0-7.2, RNDIS device

You can log in to the recovery system with ``telnet 172.16.42.1``.

The recovery also exposes the eMMC and the microSD card over USB. In your desktops ``dmesg`` you will see::

  usb-storage 1-7.2:1.2: USB Mass Storage device detected
  scsi host3: usb-storage 1-7.2:1.2
  scsi 2:0:0:0: Direct-Access     JumpDriv e eMMC                PQ: 0 ANSI: 2
  scsi 2:0:0:1: Direct-Access     JumpDriv e microSD             PQ: 0 ANSI: 2
  sd 2:0:0:0: Attached scsi generic sg1 type 0
  scsi 2:0:0:1: Attached scsi generic sg2 type 0
  sd 2:0:0:0: [sdb] 30785536 512-byte logical blocks: (15.8 GB/14.7 GiB)
  sd 2:0:0:1: [sdc] 124735488 512-byte logical blocks: (63.9 GB/59.5 GiB)
    sdb: sdb1 sdb2
  sd 2:0:0:0: [sdb] Attached SCSI removable disk
    sdc: sdc1 sdc2 sdc3 sdc4 sdc5 sdc6 sdc7 sdc8 sdc9 sdc10

The eMMC has two partitions: pmOS_boot and pmOS_root. The microSD card has 10 partitions: loader, scr, persist, boot_a, boot_b, recovery_a, recovery_b, cache, system and userdata. To update the kernel you want to mount boot_a. Check which device is the SDcard in your OS. In the example above it is ``sdc``, so you can mount it like this: ``mkdir mnt_boot_a ; sudo mount /dev/sdc4 mnt_boot_a``. Inside you'll see the kernel vmlinuz and related files: ``config-5.6.0-pine64`` ``dtb`` ``initrd.img`` ``modules/`` ``System.map-5.6.0-pine64`` ``vmlinuz``.

Building the kernel
-------------------

To install dependencies, get the `source code <https://gitlab.com/pine64-org/linux/-/tree/pine64-kernel-ubports>`_, configure and build it run the following::

  sudo apt install flex bison gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu libssl-dev
  git clone -b pine64-kernel-ubports git@gitlab.com:pine64-org/linux.git
  cd linux
  ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- KBUILD_VERSION=arm64 LOCALVERSION=-pine64 make pine64_defconfig
  ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- KBUILD_VERSION=arm64 LOCALVERSION=-pine64 make -j18 bindeb-pkg

Install the kernel
------------------

Boot into recovery and mount ``boot_a`` as shown above. Make a backup if needed. Then copy over your newly built kernel and if needed modules, etc::

  cp -v linux/debian/linux-image/boot/vmlinuz-5.6.0-pine64 mnt_boot_a/vmlinuz
  cp -v linux/debian/linux-image/boot/config-5.6.0-pine64 mnt_boot_a/
  cp -v linux/debian/linux-image/boot/System.map-5.6.0-pine64  mnt_boot_a/
  sudo rm -rf mnt_boot_a/modules
  sudo cp -rv linux/debian/linux-image/lib/modules  mnt_boot_a/

Afterwards be sure to unmount the partition so it is cleanly written `sudo umount mnt_boot_a`. Now you can reboot the PinePhone. Once booted, verify with `uname -a` that the kernel has successfully been updated by checking the build date.

.. TODO: How to update Crust? the github page has quite some instructions about building and installing it with uboot. On the UBports side it seems possible to deliver it via deb packages: https://forum.pine64.org/showthread.php?tid=9957
